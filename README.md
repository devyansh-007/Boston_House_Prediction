# Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project employs a linear regression model to predict housing prices in Boston. By analyzing various features from the dataset, such as crime rate, number of rooms, and property tax rate, the model estimates the median value of homes. The project demonstrates key machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Files
- `house_prediction.py`: Contains the implementation for data preprocessing, model training, validation, and prediction.
- `Boston.csv`: The training dataset, including features like crime rate, number of rooms, and property tax rate, used to train the model.
- `test.csv`: The dataset used for evaluating the model's performance and generating predictions on new, unseen data.
- `test_predictions.csv`: The file where the model's predictions for the test dataset are saved.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
Install the Required Dependencies: Ensure Python is installed, then install the necessary packages by running:
bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Run the Script: Execute the house_prediction.py script to preprocess data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and generate predictions:
bash

python house_prediction.py
Project Overview
Objective: To predict housing prices in Boston using a linear regression model based on various property features.
Model: A linear regression model is employed to understand the relationship between property features and housing prices.
Data Handling: The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
Output: Predictions for the test dataset are saved in test_predictions.csv for further analysis and review.



Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different models or datasets. For additional details, refer to the comments in the house_prediction.py file.
